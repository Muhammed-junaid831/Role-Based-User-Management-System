# 🚀 RoleGuard – Role-Based User Management System

A **Java console-based application** built using core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts to simulate a real-world **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system.  
This project demonstrates how **Admin** and **Normal Users** interact with an application using **Abstract Classes**, **Interfaces**, and **Runtime Polymorphism**.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Role-based access (Admin & Normal User)
- ✅ Abstract class for shared user structure
- ✅ Interface with default & static methods
- ✅ Encapsulation using getters & setters
- ✅ Method overriding & runtime polymorphism
- ✅ Clean and modular Java design

---

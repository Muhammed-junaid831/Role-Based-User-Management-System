RoleGuard – Role-Based User Management System

A Java console-based application built using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to simulate a real-world Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
The project demonstrates how Admin and Normal Users interact with an application using Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Polymorphism.

📌 Features

✅ Role-based user flow (Admin & Normal User)
✅ Abstract class for common user structure
✅ Interface with default & static methods
✅ Encapsulation using getters & setters
✅ Runtime polymorphism & method overriding
✅ Clean and modular Java design
